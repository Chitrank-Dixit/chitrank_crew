{"text": "What was implemented:\n\n* Password reset flow will be implemented as a separate API endpoint `/password-reset`.\n* The API endpoint will accept a `PasswordResetRequest` object containing the user's email address.\n* Upon receiving the request, the system will generate a magic link with token expiry via email to the provided email address.\n* The magic link will contain a unique token that can be used to reset the password.\n\nHow it will be deployed and tested:\n\n* Token expiry: Tokens will be set to expire after a short period of time (e.g., 30 minutes) to prevent unauthorized access.\n* Email sending infrastructure: The email sending infrastructure must be properly set up and configured to send emails to users who request password resets.\n* Security: Password reset requests will be implemented using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect user data.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n\n* Token expiry mechanism is functioning correctly.\n* Email sending infrastructure is properly set up and configured.\n* Password reset requests are being implemented using secure protocols.\n\nNext steps or follow-ups:\n\n* Perform thorough testing of token expiry mechanism before deployment.\n* Set up email sending infrastructure in parallel with development work.\n\nThis summary will be used to ensure alignment with the initial plan and call out any remaining risks.", "tags": ["project-plan", "password-reset-feature"]}
